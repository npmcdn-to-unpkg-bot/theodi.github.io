ODI Labs exists to explore technology that can help create and connect the web of data, through applied research, pioneer-stage software development, and open collaboration on standards and tools.

We deliver this mission through reading a lot about:

  * Technology research exploring novel problem areas, such as rich data discovery
  * Software prototyping to apply research findings, explore new technologies, and help partner organisations innovate
  * Freemium tools that make working with data simple for non-technical users
