How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA? Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. Let me out that Queen.

He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early. Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood. George Michael may be suffering from what we in the soft-sciences call Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or the "OC Disorder." O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? She tried pesto for the first time. Imagine that, 92 years old and she never tried pesto. Do you have any idea how often you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi.

Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car? A trick is something a whore does for money… or cocaine. You stay on top of her Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard. In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive. Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape-horn?

You're Killing Me, Buster. It just seems like there's still light coming in from under the door. You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. Can't a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen. And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute!

I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had. No borders, no limits… go ahead, touch the Cornballer… you know best?

Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you. You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care! You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish. ¡Soy loco por los Cornballs! Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar.

Excuse me while I circumvent you. The old reach-around. I hear the jury's still out on science. Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit. COME ON. A trick is something a whore does for money… or cocaine.

No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. This was a big get for God. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it.

Oh, yeah. The guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. COME ON! Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. GENE!! [screams] What, so the guy we are meeting with can't even grow his own hair? COME ON! Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood.

If that man's straight, then I am sober. I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block! For the same reason you should believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a hundred pennies! Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores. NO TOUCHING!
