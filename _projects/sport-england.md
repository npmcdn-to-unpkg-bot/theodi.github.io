# Overview
We did a project for Sport England to help them understand their data and communicate their performance.

# The Challenge
Sport England recently launched a new strategy, which was underpinned with key performance indicators set by the UK Government.  They wanted to understand how their data supported the new KPIs. They also wanted to find a way to communicate their performance in an open and transparent way.  

# How we helped
The ODI carried out a data audit project for Sport England. This involved working closely with them to understand the data that they held, and how this could be used to support their new KPIs.  

We framed the audit around the development of a [public performance dashboard](https://theodi.github.io/sport-england-dashboard/). This approach meant that we were asking very practical questions about Sport England's data.  For example who manages the data, is it already open, how is it collected, what does it contain?

Based on the results of the audit we were also able to build a customized Data Spectrum for Sport England.

# The Benefit
The client was able to quickly understand where the data was not yet in place to measure performance against their new KPIs.  Going through this process meant that they could address these gaps more rapidly.

The dashboard is leading to a new approach to performance management for Sport England.  Rather than seeing performance updates on a quarterly or annual basis, it is now possible to see progress as soon as the data is available; corrective action can be taken at team level in real-time.  The dashboard also provides a more open and collaborative approach to communicating performance; different departments and organizations can provide performance updates for their share of jointly-owned KPIs.

Finally, the project was a way for Sport England to demonstrate leadership in their sector.
