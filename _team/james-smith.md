bio: |
  <p>James is passionate about using web technology and open data to make a better future for everyone, with a particular focus on the environmental and social benefits that can be created.</p>

  <p>Pushing forward the state of the art in open data technology, James leads the ODI&rsquo;s <a rel="external" href="http://twitter.com/ODILabs">Labs programme</a> and the software team which delivers software projects across the ODI.</p>

  <p>James has been a software developer for over 17 years working in a variety of industries including biometrics, flight simulation and visual effects. He obtained a <a rel="external" href="https://cloud.github.com/downloads/Floppy/phd-thesis/smith03thesis.pdf">PhD from the University of Surrey creating new 3D graphics algorithms</a>.</p>

  <p>In 2007 he shifted from traditional software development to the web, developing his interest in environmental issues at the same time. Since then he has been building sustainability-related projects on the web, starting with behaviour change projects such as <a rel="external" href="http://www.carbondiet.org">The Carbon Diet</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.dothegreenthing.com">Green Thing</a>. </p>

  <p>Before joining the ODI in January 2013, he worked as a lead developer and platform evangelist at <a rel="external" href="http://www.amee.com">AMEE</a>, opening up access to greenhouse gas methodologies and data, and along the way creating the world&rsquo;s first natural language carbon calculator, AskAMEE. </p>

  <p>James is an organiser for <a rel="external" href="http://cleanweb.org.uk">Cleanweb UK</a>, a community group with over 1,000 members, that inspires and helps developers to build web applications that deal with sustainability issues.</p>

  <p>Always a fan of achievable goals, in 2015 he stood in the UK general election on a platform based around open source democracy, with open data at its core.</p>
