James is passionate about using web technology and open data to make a better future for everyone, with a particular focus on the environmental and social benefits that can be created.

Pushing forward the state of the art in open data technology, James leads the ODI’s [Labs programme](http://twitter.com/ODILabs) and the software team which delivers software projects across the ODI.

James has been a software developer for over 17 years working in a variety of industries including biometrics, flight simulation and visual effects. He obtained a [PhD from the University of Surrey creating new 3D graphics algorithms](https://cloud.github.com/downloads/Floppy/phd-thesis/smith03thesis.pdf).

In 2007 he shifted from traditional software development to the web, developing his interest in environmental issues at the same time. Since then he has been building sustainability-related projects on the web, starting with behaviour change projects such as [The Carbon Diet](http://www.carbondiet.org) and [Green Thing](http://www.dothegreenthing.com).

Before joining the ODI in January 2013, he worked as a lead developer and platform evangelist at [AMEE](http://www.amee.com), opening up access to greenhouse gas methodologies and data, and along the way creating the world’s first natural language carbon calculator, AskAMEE.

James is an organiser for [Cleanweb UK](http://cleanweb.org.uk), a community group with over 1,000 members, that inspires and helps developers to build web applications that deal with sustainability issues.

Always a fan of achievable goals, in 2015 he stood in the UK general election on a platform based around open source democracy, with open data at its core.
