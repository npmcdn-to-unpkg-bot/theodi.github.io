Stuart’s background is in local government and the public sector, training first as a journalist, and then working at Lichfield District Council as web developer.

During his time at Lichfield, Stuart describes that he was “a leading light in the world of of open data, starting one of the first local authority data catalogues, and building Ratemyplace, one of the first websites to publish local authority food safety inspections, and the first to offer an open API”.

As well as his work at Lichfield, Stuart also runs uk-postcodes.com, a linked data API for postcodes, and is contributor to planningalerts.com, an open data archive of local authority planning application data.

Outside of his technical interests, Stuart is a music lover and DJ, homebrewer, runs a community blog and is a keen cyclist. He lives in Birmingham with his wife, young son and a “small (but loud!) dog”.
