Laura joined the ODI in November 2015 as a PhD student, involved in the [WDAqua project](http://wdaqua.informatik.uni-bonn.de/) (Answering Questions using Web Data) – a collaborative research project across different European countries, researching how to turn web data into successful services. It is part of the European Commission’s [H2020 programme](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) for research and innovation. Laura is supervised by the ODI (Dr Jeni Tennison) together with the University of Southampton (Dr Elena Simperl). Her research interest is in human computer interaction and data search.

Previously Laura completed a MSc in Human Factors / Ergonomics from Loughborough Design School; before that she worked as a physiotherapist in Vienna. She teaches project management in health care at the University for Applied Sciences in Austria, and is a member of the [Chartered Institute of Ergonomics & Human Factors](http://www.ergonomics.org.uk/) in the UK. Laura moved to London from Vienna to join the ODI.
