Emilia joined the ODI in November 2015 as a PhD student, involved in the [WDAqua project](http://wdaqua.informatik.uni-bonn.de/) (Answering Questions using Web Data) – a collaborative research project across different European countries, researching how to turn web data into successful services. It is part of the European Commission’s [H2020 programme](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) for research and innovation.

Her main research is focused on improving datasets searchability by enriching their profiles and developing an algorithm for dataset selection, based on the user query.

Emilia graduated in 2015 with a degree in Software Engineering at the Silesian University of Technology and Cranfield University, as part of the European Union’s double diploma programme. During and after her studies, Emilia worked as a software developer. In her free time, Emilia likes reading fantasy books and playing strategic computer and board games.
