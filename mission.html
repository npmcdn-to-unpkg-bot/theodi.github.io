<section>
  <p>The Open Data Institute aims to unlock the supply and demand for open data,
    to communicate its value, and to share tools and guidance that help others
    to adopt open data.</p>

  <h2>Our Principles</h2>

  <h3>Be Open By Default</h3>
  <p>We will conduct our work in public by default. Anyone can join our IRC
    channel. Anyone can view our plans, which we will manage as issues and pull
    requests on our github projects. We encourage comments on, forking of and
    contributions to our work. We do this because there are more good ideas in
    the world than there are in ODI.</p>

  <h3>Borrow Mercilessly</h3>
  <p>We will build on others' work. We will avoid reinvention. We do this
    because it helps us focus our efforts into new areas. We will aim to
    contribute back to open source products we use. We do this to show our
    appreciation for what other people have done.</p>

  <h3>Experiment and Learn</h3>
  <p>We will try out new tools and new ways of working. We will reflect on
    whether they do what we need them to. We will adapt them to suit us, or try
    something else. We do this so that we continuously improve.</p>

  <h3>Share Everything</h3>
  <p>We will document and discuss our experiences, so others can learn from
    them. We will aim for the things we create to be reusable by others because
    we will reuse them ourselves. We will help others over the hurdles we have
    overcome. We do this to make the most out of everything we do.</p>

  <h3>Be Ourselves</h3>
  <p>We are all individuals (except for <a href="https://github.com/pikesley"
    class="user-mention">@pikesley</a>). We work as a team and in a community
    because we have a common purpose and because we can achieve more that way.
    We have our own interests and opinions, and will express them considerately.</p>
