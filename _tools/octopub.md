Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona.

Yeah, that's a cultural problem is what it is. You know, your average American male is in a perpetual state of adolescence, you know, arrested development. (Hey. That's the name of the show!) Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Hey campers! Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where? She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar.

I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape-horn? With spicy club sauce. Ah coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. I need a fake passport, preferably to France… I like the way they think.

Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. Whenever she'd change clothes, she'd make me wait on the balcony until zip-up, and yet anything goes at bath time. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. I didn't mean who… I meant… her? You were just a turd out there, you know? You couldn't kick, and you couldn't run, you know? You were just a turd.
