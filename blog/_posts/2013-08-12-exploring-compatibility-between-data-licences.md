<p>I <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/blog/machine-readable-rights-statements">recently wrote</a> about work underway at the ODI to help improve the machine readability of data licensing information. We&rsquo;ve already received some welcome feedback which has resulted in updates to the guides and the <a rel="external" href="http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/">Open Data Rights Statement</a> schema. If you&rsquo;ve not looked at the material yet then please let us know if you have comments.</p>

<p>The schema, along with the <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/guide/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing">publisher</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/guide/reusers-guide-open-data-licensing">re-user</a> guides to open data licensing, provides some useful advice for anyone looking to publish or use open data. Ensuring that your rights statement is machine-readable is also a key part of achieving a higher <a rel="external" href="http://certificate.theodi.org">certification for your dataset</a>.</p>

<p>However there are still some areas in which we&rsquo;ve found that people need more guidance around the implications of open data licences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how does an open licence affect your ability to create new, derived datasets?</li>
  <li>what are the implications for mixing together data and content that are covered by different open licences?</li>
</ul>

<p>These issues are particularly relevant for people looking to build <a rel="external" href="http://www.theodi.org/guide/how-make-business-case-open-data">business models</a> around open data, which often involve combining and enriching data from multiple sources. While it can be obvious how a licence might support building a product on a dataset, the implications of combining data published under different licences are not always clear.</p>

<p>To help address this we&rsquo;ve put together <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/blob/master/guides/licence-compatibility.md">an introductory document on &ldquo;licence compatibility&rdquo;</a>. This document and the supporting matrices attempt to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a summary of the key facets of the most common open data licences</li>
  <li>a discussion of the issues and use cases around licence compatibility</li>
  <li>a matrix describing which licences can be used when publishing derived datasets based upon a single source</li>
  <li>a matrix describing how datasets derived from multiple sources might be licensed</li>
</ul>

<p>The document builds on previous work by the Creative Commons, extending it to include licences from the Open Data Commons and the UK public sector. The ultimate goal is to have a clearer set of guidance to support these use cases along with some tools to help guide people towards choosing the best licence for their work.</p>

<p>The document is still at an early stage and would benefit from review and feedback from the wider community. We would love to hear your feedback on the work to date. If you&rsquo;d like to contribute then please <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/issues">submit issues and comments on github</a>.</p>
