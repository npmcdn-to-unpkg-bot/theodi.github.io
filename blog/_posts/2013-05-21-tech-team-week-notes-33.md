    alt=\"OpenTech\" /></p>\n\n<p>Last week saw important progress on a few projects
    we&rsquo;re working on. It ended with a great conference on Saturday:\x02<a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://opentech.org.uk/2013/\">Open Tech</a>.\x02Despite being on the weekend,
    you could find most of the ODI tech team there. It&rsquo;s safe to say that the
    conference was a great success with plenty of interesting and inspiring talks.</p>\n\n<p>Jeni
    attended the Open Data User Group meeting, where we presented an updated benefits
    case for opening up a specific data set. She also went to\x02the\x02<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information\">Shakespeare
    Review</a>\x02launch and spoke at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.eduserv.org.uk/newsandevents/events/2013/symposium#Speakers\">Eduserve
    Symposium</a>.\x02On Friday, Jeni sat in on White October&rsquo;s user testing
    of the\x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.github.io/open-data-certificate/\">Open
    Data Certificate</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Sam had a rather frustrating week working with
    Drupal. We hope that his and our woes are soon over.\x02James and Stuart spent
    also time working on the\x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/dataset-metadata-survey\">Dataset
    Metadata Survey</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Tom spend most of his days for\x02background work
    on an European project proposals. He and I also worked on a guide on how to publish
    big data. We plan to share more at the end of the next sprint.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly,
    we are virtually ready to start our first research project!</p>\n"
