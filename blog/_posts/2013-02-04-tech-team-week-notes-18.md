  content: "<p>In ODI time, last week was week #18, and the tech team were settled
    in and starting to put tools and systems in place.</p>\n\n<p>Our first weeknotes
    brought a bunch of visitors into our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"irc://irc.freenode.net/theodi\">IRC
    channel</a>, where they got to experience our internal tech chatter, and the occasional
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://odimemes.tumblr.com\">meme</a>. Sam&rsquo;s
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/better-living-through-openness\">blog
    post</a> at the end of the week brought in a bunch more. It&rsquo;s so great to
    see the channel with people in it; it&rsquo;s easy to say &lsquo;we&rsquo;re going
    to have an open IRC channel&rsquo;, but to have people in it who aren&rsquo;t
    us is incredibly satisfying. \x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a>\x02mainly
    spent last week bootstrapping his Ruby skills, as it&rsquo;s going to be our language
    of choice. His summary: &ldquo;I thought this was just for hipsters, but it&rsquo;s
    actually really good&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s getting on well with it, but rather disturbed
    that other people have already found his code (the scary part of working in public).
    \x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a>
    has been wrestling with various infrastructure projects, and <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"https://github.com/Atalanta/cucumber-chef/issues/96\">swearing at horrible
    dependency problems</a> in the latest version of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/Atalanta/cucumber-chef\">cucumber-chef</a>.
    \x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/james-smith\">I</a> was
    busy building things like our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.leftronic.com/share/g/OqF269\">tech
    team metrics dashboard</a>, getting it up on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitpic.com/bzpz2n\">a
    screen in the office</a>, and getting our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://jenkins.theodi.org/\">Jenkins
    server</a> to do what we want it to do in terms of continuous integration and
    deployment. \x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/jeni\">Jeni</a>&rsquo;s
    been in charge of the whole place this week, which has kept her plenty busy, on
    top of writing stories for our first sprint. \x02We also all sat down for a discussion
    on URI design and versioning. As a developer unwise in the esoterica of these
    things, I was surprised to discover that it can be <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/group/track/issues/14\">rather
    controversial</a>. However, we all managed to agree on our approach without coming
    to blows. The result can wait for another blog post though&hellip; \x02All in
    all we&rsquo;re pretty much ready to go. In week #19 we start building things
    that <em>other</em> people want! </p>\n"
