  excerpt: For the ODI tech team, last week was “20% week”. This is when we have time
    to ourselves to spend on innovation projects, learning, and so on. When we started,
    we tried to do a Google-style one-day-a-week rhythm for this time, but found rapidly
    that it was getting squeezed. Having one week in every five blocked out is a much
    more successful way of allocating the time, for us.

    when we have time to ourselves to spend on innovation projects, learning, and
    so on. When we started, we tried to do a Google-style one-day-a-week rhythm for
    this time, but found rapidly that it was getting squeezed. Having one week in
    every five blocked out is a much more successful way of allocating the time, for
    us.</p>\n\n<p>So, who got up to what?</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a>
    (who recently promoted himself to Head of Robots) spends his innovation time on
    projects that are fairly hard to tell apart from the rest of his work, spent as
    it is on automation of various types, but this week he put a lot of effort into
    bringing our test-driven infrastructure up to date with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/Atalanta/cucumber-chef\">cucumber-chef
    3</a>. Apparently this is a lot faster and neater, so he&rsquo;s happy.</p>\n\n<p><a
    rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison\">Stuart</a>
    spent the week <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dashboards.theodi.org/tech\">overhauling
    our tech dashboard</a>. The old one had suffered some bitrot, so was due a few
    bugfixes. He also brought it into our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/dashboards\">main
    dashboards app</a>, which uses <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://shopify.github.io/dashing/\">Dashing</a>,
    rather than using the hosted <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.leftronic.com/\">Leftronic</a>
    solution which we started with. This is a step towards a larger piece of dashboard
    work we&rsquo;ll be doing over the next few weeks.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich</a> spent the week working
    out tech demos for various projects and writing about the quantified self, followed
    on Friday by a visit to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.barbican.org.uk/post/58241766335/the-ministry-of-measurement-hack-the-barbican\">Ministry
    of Measurement</a>. He spent some of his 20% time working out ODI email statistics,
    but was &ldquo;too successful&rdquo;; too many automated emails\x02made it a bit
    useless.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a>
    spent the week partly in shock at the completion of our FP7 validation process,
    and partly working on various other project proposals. He&rsquo;s hoping to get
    some proper 20% time in this week instead.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/jeni\">Jeni</a>
    spent the week responding to some bids, finalising proposals, and working on technical
    things to do with persistent resolvable identifiers (definitely Jeni&rsquo;s happy
    place, that last one).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, although 20% weeks are easier
    to block out, things do still happen that get in the way, and <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/james-smith\">I</a> spent most of the week
    chasing down a duplication bug in our invoicing system. It turned out to be bad
    HTML encoding in the hosted invoicing app we&rsquo;re using, but fortunately I
    could adapt our code to avoid the problem. Then, on Friday, I turned to innovation
    thoughts, and cracked out a quick demo showing CSV diffs in Gitlab, which I then
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/adapting-git-simple-data\">wrote
    a big old blog post about</a>.</p>\n"
