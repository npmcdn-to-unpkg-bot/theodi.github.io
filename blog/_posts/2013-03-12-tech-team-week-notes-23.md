  content: "<p>It&rsquo;s ODI week #23, and in tech land it&rsquo;s the first week
    of Sprint #3. Time is going very fast!</p>\n\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t quite hit everything
    we wanted to get done in Sprint #2, so <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison\">Stuart</a>\x02and
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/james-smith\">I</a>\x02spent
    the first half of the week finishing that off and launching our <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://theodi.org/join-us\">membership signup process</a>. We then\x02got
    cracking on building capabilities for our new member directory, which is the main
    target for Sprint #3.\x02I also started playing around with a little side project
    that you&rsquo;ll hopefully hear more of later, when it gets more interesting.</p>\n\n<p><a
    rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a> has been
    doing architecture thinking on the member directory, which will finally include
    some actual Open Data(!), and also had some good fun\x02imagining the future of
    data for\x02a potential major partner.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/jeni\">Jeni</a>
    spent the week talking to large numbers\x02of\x02people, both\x02at the Local
    Government Association workshop on &ldquo;Making Transparency Work for You&rdquo;,
    and then\x02talking about open data\x02at QCon. She also drafted <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/draft-guides-licensing\">two guides to licensing
    data</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a>
    has been edging us ever-closer to our target\x02of continuous deployment, via
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/chef-envbuilder\">chef incantations</a>,
    burnt offerings, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/innovating-open\">recursion</a>,
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atrocity_Archives\">phase
    conjugate grammars for extra-dimensional summoning</a>,\x02and other such dark
    magic. The rest of us really need to learn what he&rsquo;s done soon, before he
    accidentally opens a portal into another universe and all our code falls into
    it.</p>\n"
