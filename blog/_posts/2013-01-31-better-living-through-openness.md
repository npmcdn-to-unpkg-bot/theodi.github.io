<p>I&rsquo;ve run and managed <a rel="external" href="http://www.freebsd.org/">various</a> <a rel="external" href="http://www.openbsd.org/">open-source</a> <a rel="external" href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html">operating systems</a>. I&rsquo;ve known the incomparable joy of typing <strong>make buildworld</strong> on a FreeBSD box and <em>rebuilding the entire system from source</em>. I&rsquo;ve also had to endure the pain of looking after a couple of different flavours of old-school closed Unix, where applying patches meant downloading opaque binary files, throwing a dice and crossing your fingers, and then finding that Java still didn&rsquo;t work. Quite aside from the ideological and political reasons for favouring Openness, it&rsquo;s just so much more appealing from a technical point of view.</p>

<p>Open is good. Open is liberating. Open is technically and aesthetically beautiful. It&rsquo;s safe to say I&rsquo;m a fan of Open. I hope you can see why I wanted to come and work at the ODI.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re Open By Default here. <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi">All of our code is open</a>. This keeps us honest, for one thing: we&rsquo;re far less likely to push an Ugly Hack if everybody can see what we&rsquo;re doing. Score one for Open in the War On Cruft. It will also (hopefully) help us to build a community around the Big Things we&rsquo;re endeavouring to do here. As a nice bonus, it makes deploys that bit easier - no keys required! Of course there&rsquo;s risk, too. You know those times when you put passwords and keys into source control (even though you knew you shouldn&rsquo;t) because that was just easier and you were using a closed repo? Yeah, we can&rsquo;t do that. Especially since Github made it <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/search/advanced">really easy to search for stuff</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of community, our <a rel="external" href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#theodi">IRC channel</a> is also open. We do work in here, and you can all come hang out with us while we do it. We hope this will be a great vector for building an alliance of like-minded souls. Our <a rel="external" href="http://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a> also lives there, and who doesn&rsquo;t like a Hubot?</p>

<p>Our <a rel="external" href="http://jenkins.theodi.org/">continuous integration system</a> is open too, which is a great incentive for us to keep everything green, and this feeds our <a rel="external" href="https://www.leftronic.com/share/g/OqF269">Super Awesome Dashboard</a> (and at the time of writing, I see the Failboat under Jenkins. Oops).</p>

<p>So, for the most part, being Open By Default is exhilarating. But I suspect that streaking at a cricket match is exhilarating, too. And sometimes it does feel like we&rsquo;re running around naked&hellip;</p>
