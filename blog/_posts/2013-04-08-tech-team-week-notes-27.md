    <p>The week started off for the whole team with the ODI Brand Tech team workshop: a great excercise to distill our core values and flesh out what we believe the ODI stands for.</p>

    <p><strong>Stuart</strong> worked a bit more on bringing the office calendar into production as well as make the development path of the ODI website &ldquo;a bit more sane&rdquo;.</p>

    <p><strong>James</strong> and <strong>Sam</strong> made the <a rel="external" href="http://directory.theodi.org/">member&rsquo;s directory</a> available; the link, at the moment, remains a placeholder until more content shows up.</p>

    <p><strong>Jeni</strong> worked on the Open Data Certificate and got some really good feedback.</p>

    <p><strong>I</strong> spent some of my time with the newly released <a rel="external" href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R 3.0.0</a> and added a list of editorial comments to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-vocab-data-cube-20130312/">W3C Data Cube</a> vocabulary.</p>

    <p>Lastly, a great <a rel="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s">80s</a> fad is back with the <strong>Rubik&rsquo;s Cube</strong> making frequent appearances in our office. If you want to get started, the internet hosts oodles of guides â€“ perhaps one of the more visual explanations comes from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/12/16/science/20081216_RUBIK_GRAPHIC.html">New York Times</a>.</p>
