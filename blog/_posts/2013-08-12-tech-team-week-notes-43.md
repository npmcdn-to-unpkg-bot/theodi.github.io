    was, in fact, visiting them and\x02worked\x02on publishing data for Open Data
    Certificates a lot of this week. Besides\x02disappearing into a <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://oauth.net/\">OAuth</a> rabbit hole,\x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/james-smith\">James</a>\x02and\x02<a
    rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a>\x02had
    a successful week in building our new platform.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a>\x02was working on more research
    strategy and plenty of networking. He also started to receive interesting applications
    for the\x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/jobs/community-engagement-manager\">Community
    Engagement Manager</a> role (closes\x02by 12 noon on Monday 19th August 2013).</p>\n\n<p><a
    rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/jeni\">Jeni</a>\x02worked on
    our response to the HMRC consultation on opening up the VAT register. She\x02also
    presented at a seminar at the Home Office on Thursday afternoon and caught up
    with the Open Standards Challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Jeni and I also spent some time
    on how to further\x02develop the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/peer-peer-lending-businesses-lead-way-opening-financial-data\">peer-to-peer
    lending</a> project. The rest of my time\x02was spent preparing\x02for the\x02<a
    rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.r-project.org/\">R</a>\x02training for Scottish
    Government statisticians and then actually holding it\x02one\x02day\x02in Edinburgh.
    The slides, on their own, are here:\x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/sites/default/files/Scotland-R-training-2013-08-07.pdf\">Scotland-R-training-2013-08-07.pdf</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly,
    on Friday we had an\x02Office Tidy Up â€“ our desks are clean again.\x02</p>\n"
