  excerpt: This week was a relatively quiet week, with various members of the tech
    team being away for some portion of the week. Despite this quietness, it seemed
    to be a rather productive week, with lots of exciting projects in the pipeline.

    seemed to be a rather productive week, with lots of exciting projects in the pipeline.</p>\n\n<p><a
    rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich</a> was away
    on holiday until Wednesday, but spent lots of time preparing for delivering <a
    rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.r-project.org/\">R</a> training for Scottish
    Government statisticians, which is very exciting.</p>\n\n<p>I worked a lot with
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/james-smith\">James</a> this
    week, continuing to get the moving parts of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gov.uk\">gov.uk</a>
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://github.com/alphagov\">platform</a> into place
    to demonstrate using the platform to publish our own content with our own look
    and feel.</p>\n\n<p>In the later part of the week, James spent a bit of time with
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a> on
    deploying the publishing platform into &lsquo;preduction&rsquo; (not quite production,
    but a server that allows us demonstrate the platform to everyone), and spent even
    longer fixing failing tests.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a>
    was away on Thursday and Friday, but in the first half of the week he did some
    prep for a talk from Max (one of our research interns, who also left us this week)
    about the research project he&rsquo;s been working on whilst at the ODI, and had
    a call with Quanta (one of our partners). He also attended the advisory board
    meeting of the EyeHub project (another one of our members).</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://theodi.org/people/jeni\">Jeni</a> prepared for and attended the
    Board meeting on Thursday, chatted to a couple of potential partners about localising
    the Open Data Certificates for other countries and\x02discussed the local government
    projects who have won Breakthrough Fund funding. She also\x02attended the first
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/news/odi-welcomes-new-members\">ODI
    member event</a>, and worked on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/what-national-information-infrastructure\">National
    Information Infrastructure blog post</a> as well as other policy development.</p>\n"
