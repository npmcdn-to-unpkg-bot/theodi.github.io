    <p>This week was a very busy week, with much of the tech team focused on the launch of the <a rel="external" href="https://certificates.theodi.org/">Open Data Certificates site</a>.</p>

    <p>Sam spent much of the week flexing his ops muscles and working with our development partners <a rel="external" href="http://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/">White October</a> on getting the Open Data Certificates site live, load tested, and into production in time for the launch on Saturday.</p>

    <p>I started the week working on <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi/hoppler">Hoppler</a> our (still in developement) Ruby toolkit for backing up and restoring MySQL databases. I also spent a decent chunk of time working with White October squishing bugs and starting work on being able to automate the creation of certificates by integrating the ODC site with <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi/data_kitten">Data Kitten</a>.</p>

    <p>Tom started the week at an away day with the University of Southampton Web and Internet Science Research Group, and gained some really useful insights into the range of research that has been going on, he also spent some time working on our best practice guide for publishing big data, and prepared for meetings and his upcoming trip to India.</p>

    <p>Ulrich worked on an ongoing project with financial data and was also at the University of Southampton Web and Internet Science Research Group away day and planning for some planning for meetups the following week. He also wrote some more on the primer for big data publishing and privacy.</p>

    <p>Jeni spent a good chunk of time fretting about the launch of the Open Data Certificates site, but also found time to deliver a <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.github.io/presentations/2013-06-gds.html">very well-received presentation</a> to our friends over at the Government Digital Service.</p>
