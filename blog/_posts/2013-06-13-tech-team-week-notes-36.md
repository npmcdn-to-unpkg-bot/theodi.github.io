  excerpt: One of the things we decided to do when the ODI Tech Team first formed
    was to publish week notes – a weekly (obviously) summary of what we’d been up
    to. Personally one of the motivators for doing this was reading Libby Miller’s
    excellent week notes on the BBC R&D blog. I loved the richness of insight these
    notes gave on what the team was up to, and they remain the gold standard for me.
    What has become apparent since is that writing them well is really hard! There’s
    always so much ‘real work’ to do that taking the time to complete the week notes
    takes real discipline, and keeping track of the many things we’re each doing is
    no small task.

    Tech Team</a> first formed was to publish week notes &ndash; a weekly (obviously)
    summary of what we&rsquo;d been up to. Personally one of the motivators for doing
    this was reading <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2011/08/prototyping-weeknotes-73.shtml\">Libby
    Miller&rsquo;s excellent week notes</a> on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/\">BBC
    R&amp;D blog</a>. I loved the richness of insight these notes gave on what the
    team was up to, and they remain the gold standard for me. What has become apparent
    since is that writing them well is really hard! There&rsquo;s always so much &lsquo;real
    work&rsquo; to do that taking the time to complete the week notes takes real discipline,
    and keeping track of the many things we&rsquo;re each doing is no small task.</p>\n\n<p>To
    try and address that, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/james-smith\">James</a>
    got us setup recently with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://offbott.com/\">Offbott</a>
    (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/stml/offbot\">code on GitHub</a>),
    a neat little service that periodically emails you to ask what you&rsquo;ve been
    doing. Hit &lsquo;Reply&rsquo;, add a brief summary of the day&rsquo;s work, and
    this goes into the collective pot for your project. You can then review it online
    and get a weekly email digest of everyone&rsquo;s activity.</p>\n\n<p>So is it
    solving our problems? To an extent, yes. We have 4/7 of the team actively using
    it, and the weekly records provide a decent summary. Personally I find it useful
    to stop and record where the day has gone, though some way to indicate the relative
    effort involved in each task would be helpful. On the flip side, the greater the
    structure needed in the emails, the greater the effort required to file a report
    &ndash; and it&rsquo;s precisely that simplicity that encourages me to participate.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway&hellip;last
    week was our 20% week. James was away, as was <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/jeni\">Jeni</a>
    for some of the week. The rest of her time was spent tying up loose ends for the
    upcoming launch of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.github.io/open-data-certificate/\">Open
    Data Certificate</a>. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison\">Stuart</a>
    embarked on his project to automatically identify &lsquo;data&rsquo; areas/microsites
    on\x02Local Authority Web sites, and see what proportion of them are reachable
    within three clicks of the homepage (one of the criteria in the Certificate).
    The simple answer is &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard&rdquo;, not least because many sites
    return an <em>HTTP 200 OK</em> when they actually mean <em>404 Not Found</em>.
    Stu&rsquo;s 20% of 20% project, inspired by BBC Watchdog, involved creating a
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.pezholio.co.uk/2013/06/my-response-to-bbc-watchdog-a-chrome-plugin-for-just-eat/\">Chrome
    Plugin</a> that revealed his favourite takeaway has declining hygiene standards.</p>\n\n<p><a
    rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a> spent
    the week in the depths of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-rackspace/pull/4#issuecomment-19056323\">Vagrant</a>
    and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/zpatten/cc-chef-repo/issues/3#issuecomment-18969432\">Cucumber
    Chef</a>, hoping that someone would eventually hear his cries and merge his pull
    requests. Continuing the food theme, I mined historic menu data from one of our
    favourite local eateries and attempted to predict whether particular options would
    be served on a particular day. A trivial use case, but some interesting learnings
    and powerful examples of the benefits of structured data. Yes, it&rsquo;s possible
    to parse menu data from plain text (using Regexp, IMAP, and Gmail as the backend!),
    but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be that hard. It was also great to dust off my R
    skills to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2010/01/21/how-to-make-a-heatmap-a-quick-and-easy-solution/\">generate
    a heatmap</a> of the results.</p>\n\n<p>As for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich</a>,
    he&rsquo;s been so busy that he didn&rsquo;t even manage to have his 20% time.
    Instead, he spent the week working on a research project in the financial sector
    and getting <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyBZG50XoXY\">Internet-famous</a>
    in at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://unconvention.eu/\">Unconvention</a> in
    Brussels.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. This post about Offbott increased our uptake to 6/7 team
    members. Now we just need to write something to auto-summarise our Offbott reports&hellip;</p>\n"
