    <p>This week saw the beginning of our second sprint and my first sprint proper as a full-time member of the ODI. First on the agenda, was to demo our <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/courses">completed product</a> (currently being populated), and the rest of Monday was devoted to planning for sprint number two.</p>

    <p>For this sprint, we&rsquo;ll be building a membership management system, allowing people and organisations to sign up as members of the ODI (more on that soon!).</p>

    <p>After spending a good portion of time with <a rel="external" href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> in the previous sprint, I was glad to get back into the world of Ruby, and spent much of Tuesday pairing with James and getting my head around <a rel="external" href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>. I had a day out of the office on Wednesday acting as an expert mentor helping voluntary organisations in London get their heads around open data.</p>

    <p>The rest of my week was spent pairing with <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/tom-heath">Tom</a> on building a Rails app to take a member&rsquo;s details, ready to pipe into <a rel="external" href="http://www.xero.com/">Xero</a> (our accounting system) to generate invoices, and add to <a rel="external" href="http://capsulecrm.com/">Capsule</a> (our CRM system).</p>

    <p><a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley">Sam</a> got his feet wet with Drupal, as well as doing a sterling job with Tom on migrating the website to a new infrastructure, resulting in less than 3 minutes of downtime, and also giving us a more resilient infrastructure.</p>

    <p><a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/james-smith">James</a> spent some time doing knowledge transfer with the rest of the team, and also worked on the design for the Drupal page which will spell out the benefits of becoming a member of the ODI. He put in some ground work for some of the backend work that Tom and I will be picking up on this week.</p>

    <p>Despite a perfect storm of half term week and a poorly child to deal with, <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/jeni">Jeni</a> spent some time with Gavin &amp; Stu on Thursday hearing some great pitches for open data stories from our incubees, worked on <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi/bootstrap">ODI-fying</a> <a rel="external" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> to make styling our apps easier, and presented at the <a rel="external" href="http://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Data/events/97340682/">Women in Data meetup</a> on Friday evening.</p>
