    alt=\"Big Data Week\" /></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://bigdataweek.com/\">Big
    Data Week</a>\x02just happened, in London and around the globe. And as <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/03/29/nate-silver-gets-real-about-big-data\">others</a>
    before me have pointed out, it has become <em>de rigueur</em> to ascribe all sorts
    of supernatural powers to big data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There is a sentiment that
    if you have enough data you are bound to get the right answer.</strong>\x02A\x02statistician
    will tell you more is <em>not</em> necessarily better; something also a <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/what-is-data-science-really\">data scientist</a>,
    a software engineer or a business person may tell you, but probably less emphatically.</p>\n\n<p>I
    have a feeling statisticians\x02tend towards cynicism, perhaps because you realise
    how much randomness is out there. Patterns that seem miraculous, like three children
    born on the same day <em>in one familiy</em>, are almost expected in a population
    the size of the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Probabilities are not intuitive. Numerous examples
    show us why, for example: How many people do you need to invite to your party,
    for a 50/50 chance, that two are born on the same day? [1] But this is a topic
    for another day, back to the wonders of big data.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the statistical
    community supports the Big Data Week because we recognise the enormous potential
    of large data sets. We can find <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.quora.com/Google/What-do-statisticians-do-at-Google\">statisticians
    at Google</a> and there are many parallels between statisticians and big data
    analysts (who might call themselves something else).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/stats.jpg\"
    alt=\"\" />2013 is the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.statistics2013.org/\">Year
    of Statistics</a>. \x02But what is statistics? While I don&rsquo;t want to answer
    this question here, I find that Bradley Efron is a great source for bits of wisdom:
    &ldquo;Statistics is the science of information gathering, especially when the
    information arrives in little pieces instead of big ones.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>My
    vision is that the data arrives in little, <strong>open</strong> pieces. Then
    we can stick them together and create big data. In fact, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.okfn.org/2013/04/22/forget-big-data-small-data-is-the-real-revolution/\">Rufus
    Pollock</a> from the Open Knowledge Foundation goes one step further: &ldquo;forget
    big data, small data is the real revolution&rdquo;. He points out that size doesn&rsquo;t
    matter and that we should focus on a distributed ecosystem of information.</p>\n\n<p>We
    can summarise my statistical view on big data quite succinctly with:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bigger
    Data &permil;Better Data</strong></p>\n\n<p>For big data to be <em>better data</em>
    it needs to</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>solve relevant problems,</li>\n  <li>keep noise,
    bias and spurious results at a minimum,</li>\n  <li>and, crucially, have a team
    of researchers who are able to understand it fully.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Big data
    advocates envision a world where we are free of hyptheses, or even the scientific
    method, and simply &ldquo;let the data speak&rdquo;. Indeed, we should leave plenty
    of room for methods that are not model-based. However, data is not neutral. We
    have to <strong>interpret</strong> it.</p>\n\n<p>Nate Silver, the current poster
    boy of statisticians, writes in his book <em>The Signal and the Noise</em> about
    big data:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The numbers have no way of speaking for themselves.
    We speak for them. We imbue them with meaning. […] Before we demand more of our
    data, we have to demand more of ourselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He shows,
    for example, how more data has only hardened the sides in a political divide.
    Similarly, more data within the global warming research helped little to resolve
    the debate. On the other hand, Silver is actually known for his forecast models
    and smart predictions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, are we excited about big data?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It
    depends.</p>\n\n<p>(A statistician&rsquo;s answer to most questions.)</p>\n\n<p>\x02\n-

    the birthday problem. You think conditional probabilities are better? Let me know
