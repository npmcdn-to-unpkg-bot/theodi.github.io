  excerpt: Last week was 20% week. I spent a bit of time setting up and playing with
    the remarkable dokku, which may prove useful for some of our upcoming projects.
    I also managed to wrap my head around some of the new features in cucumber-chef
    3, to which Iâ€™ll be moving our infrastructure-testing stuff in due course.

    <p>Last week was 20% week. I spent a bit of time setting up and playing with the remarkable <a rel="external" href="http://progrium.com/blog/2013/06/19/dokku-the-smallest-paas-implementation-youve-ever-seen/">dokku</a>, which may prove useful for some of our upcoming projects. I also managed to wrap my head around some of the new features in <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/Atalanta/cucumber-chef">cucumber-chef 3</a>, to which I&rsquo;ll be moving our infrastructure-testing stuff in due course.</p>

    <p><a rel="external" href="http://www.theodi.org/people/james-smith">James</a> and I delivered the <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.github.io/presentations/open-development.html#/titlepage">Friday Lunchtime Lecture</a>, which required a bit of preparation (including <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi/presentations/commit/66bf34a0e139b0027715219b89f338e23c83dbdc">Jekyll-ising the reveal.js presentation</a>), but most of James&rsquo;s week was taken up with working out <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi/csv-my-git">how to usefully diff CSVs with Git</a>, as well as getting himself booked in for <a rel="external" href="http://okfn.org/okcon/">OKCon</a> in September.</p>

    <p><a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz">Ulrich</a> spent a couple of days training statisticians in Edinburgh, but then his main focus was on the <a rel="external" href="http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/">peer-to-peer lending data</a>, which made it to the front page of today&rsquo;s Financial Times!</p>

    <p><a rel="external" href="http://www.theodi.org/people/tom-heath">Tom</a> was occupied with building research relationships with new people at a couple of institutions, namely Edinburgh and QMUL, as well as continuing to pursue the FP7 funding.</p>

    <p><a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison">Stuart</a>&rsquo;s 20% time was taken up with some initial investigations into how many addresses are listed within available open data; he also built most of the peer-to-peer site.</p>

    <p><a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/jeni">Jeni</a> worked on how to embed open data into procurement policy, and discussed and supported the use of <a rel="external" href="https://certificates.theodi.org">Open Data Certificates</a> in a variety of organisations large and small.</p>

    <p>However, the main thing we have learned this week is that <a rel="external" href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=national+animal+of+scotland&amp;oq=national+animal+od&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l3.4692j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">the national animal of Scotland is the unicorn</a>.</p>
