<p>At its simplest, open data requires just two things: data and openness. The key to openness is <strong>how the data is licensed</strong>. Data that doesn&rsquo;t explicitly have an open licence is not open data.</p>

<p>Organisations who are publishing data need to understand how to choose and apply a licence to the data that they make available. They ask questions like: &ldquo;What does it mean to license data?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What licence should we use?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How can we indicate the licence that a dataset is available under?&rdquo;</p>

<p>People and companies who are consuming data need to understand what they can legally do with the data that they get access with. They ask questions like: &ldquo;What requirements can a licence place on me?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What different licences do publishers use?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How can we find out what licence a dataset is available under?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have therefore drafted two guides on licensing, with a particular focus on licensing open data:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://personal.crocodoc.com/5PQoIMV">Draft publisher&rsquo;s guide to licensing</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://personal.crocodoc.com/NsmIzfp">Draft re-user&rsquo;s guide to licensing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Before we publish these guides, we would like to have your feedback on whether they address your questions, and where we could improve them. We&rsquo;ve put them on <a rel="external" href="http://personal.crocodoc.com/">crocodoc</a> so that you can add comments, but feel free to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#106;&#101;&#110;&#105;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#111;&#100;&#105;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">email</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://twitter.com/ukodi">tweet</a> if you prefer. </p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll later roll your comments into the guides, and publish both the finished guides and a post that summarises the comments we receive.</p>
