  excerpt: With the unseasonal spring snowfall and freezing temparatures, you might
    have become a bit more aware of your local council recently, with a lot of the
    stuff that we take for granted being knocked sideways by the onslaught of frozen
    water falling from the sky.

    might have become a bit more aware of your local council recently, with a lot
    of the stuff that we take for granted being knocked sideways by the onslaught
    of frozen water falling from the sky.</p>\n\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s about much
    more than just gritting roads and collecting bins - local government touches all
    aspects of our lives, from education to care for the elderly, it&rsquo;s a constant
    presence.</p>\n\n<p>This is why it&rsquo;s important that local government makes
    good use of open data, as organisations that are so key to the lives of so many
    people need\x02to be open and accountable.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind (and as
    an ex-local government bod myself), I was pleased to represent the ODI at the
    recent <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/web/guest/events/-/journal_content/56/10171/3863451/EVENT-TEMPLATE\">Making
    Transparency Work For You</a> conference in Leeds.</p>\n\n<p>This event bought
    people from across the North East and North West to see what was happening on
    the national stage, as well as examples of upcoming projects and good practice
    locally.</p>\n\n<p>From a national perspective, Ed Parkes from the Cabinet Office
    talked about policy developments including the strengthening of the Freedom of
    Information Act to include a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/legislation/protection-freedoms-bill/\">Right
    to Data</a> and Gesche Schmid from the Local Government Association talked about,
    amongst other things, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/New-funding-to-accelerate-benefits-of-open-data-684c1.aspx\">Breakthrough
    Fund</a>, a pot of money designed to help councils publish data in new and innovative
    ways.</p>\n\n<p>There was also talk about making data linkable and sharable by
    using common standards from Paul Davidson from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legsb.gov.uk/\">Local
    eGovernment Standards Body</a>, and Mike Thacker from the <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://www.esd.org.uk/esdtoolkit/default.aspx\">esd-Toolkit</a> spoke about
    some of the standards that are already being used to link up datasets from across
    government.</p>\n\n<p>Steve Peters from the Department for Communities and Local
    Government also showcased <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/data\">open
    data communities</a>, a linked data store for statistics about local government
    which is collected nationally, and is already\x02beginning to be used and linked
    with other datasets by councils such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://linkeddata.hants.gov.uk/land-supply-mapper/map.html\">Hampshire</a>
    and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://lambeth-in-numbers.co.uk\">Lambeth</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The
    most interesting take away for me, however, was seeing the work that has been
    done by councils locally, such as Trafford, who have used open data in partnership
    with local communities to identify areas that are in need of funding and use that
    data to support funding applications.</p>\n\n<p>It was also interesting to see
    councils around Sheffield joining together and engaging with the open data communties
    in their region, as well as identifying common datasets that they could all open
    up in a common format (which is a great way to begin to adopt standards).</p>\n\n<p>Overall
    I was struck by how much innovation is going on in the sector, and how much open
    data work has been done\x02since I left local government (only eight\x02weeks
    ago!). Because of this (and because I think it&rsquo;s really important that more
    of this stuff gets publicised outside government) I&rsquo;ll certainly be making
    it my mission to seek\x02out and share\x02more local government open data stories
    as time goes on.</p>\n\n<p><em>You can see the slides from the event, and other
    regional events in London and Bristol, on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.esd.org.uk/esdtoolkit/News/NewsDetail.aspx?Item=754\">ESD
