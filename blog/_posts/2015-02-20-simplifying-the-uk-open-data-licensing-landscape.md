description: "The Ordnance Survey has adopted the Open Government Licence (OGL) as
  the default licence for all of their open data products. This is great news for
  the open data community as it simplifies licensing around many important UK open
  datasets. It’s also an opportunity for other data publishers to reflect on their
  own approach to data licensing.\r\n\r\nThe original “OS Open Data licence” was based
  on a customised version of the first version of the OGL. Unfortunately these changes
  left the open data community in some doubt about how the new clauses were to be
  interpreted. For example the Open Street Map community decided that the terms were
  incompatible with the Open Database Licence, requiring them to seek explicit permission
  to use the open data. These are exactly the problems that standard open licences
  are meant to avoid.\r\n\r\nBy switching licence the Ordnance Survey have not only
  resolved outstanding confusion but have also ensured that their data can be freely
  and easily mixed with other UK government sources. The knock-on effects will also
  simplify the licensing of local government data released under the Public Sector
  Mapping Agreement. The result is a much clearer and simpler open data landscape
  in the UK.\r\n\r\nAt the ODI we’ve previously highlighted our concerns around the
  proliferation of open government licences. Many of these licences have taken a similar
  approach to the OS Open Data licence and are derived from earlier versions of the
  OGL.\r\n\r\nWe think this is a good time for all data publishers to consider their
  licensing choices:\r\n\r\n    If your custom licence is derived from the OGL then
  consider adopting the original version unchanged.\r\n    If you’re using a bespoke
  licence then consider how adopting a standard licence such as the OGL or the Creative
  Commons Attribution licence could benefit potential reusers.\r\n\r\nFor more background
  read through our guidance on open data licensing and our draft guidance on problematic
  licensing terms.\r\n\r\nUltimately, simplification of the open data licensing landscape
  benefits everyone and we ask other publishers to follow the Ordnance Survey’s lead.\r\n\r\nImage:
