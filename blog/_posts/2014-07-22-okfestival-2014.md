  excerpt: I spent last week in Berlin at the 2014 Open Knowledge Festival, along

  content: "<p>I spent last week in Berlin at the 2014 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://2014.okfestival.org/\">Open
    Knowledge Festival</a>, along with a good number of other ODI staff.</p>\n\n<p>My
    main reason for going over was to give a talk at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvconf.com/\">csv,conf</a>,
    a fringe conference about &ldquo;small data&rdquo; and the practicalities of working
    with it. There was a lot of talk about validation, testing, and collaboration
    on data, which will be useful information for our future experiments in that area.
    There was a particularly good talk by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/nickstenning\">Nick
    Stenning</a>, technical director of Open Knowledge, about containerised shipping
    and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/\">datapackages</a>.
    His argument was that just as the international shipping market exploded once
    the container was invented, standard boxes help us to work with all sorts of things,
    and that&rsquo;s what we need for data. I quite agree, which is one reason that
    all the tools we build at the ODI support datapackage, and we contribute to pushing
    the spec forward.</p>\n\n<p>My own talk was about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io\">csvlint.io</a>,
    our tool for CSV validation. You can watch it below, though the first 30 seconds
    or so have been lost to history due to a late-starting camera! The slides are
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.github.io/presentations/2014-07-15-csvlint.html\">also
    online</a>, so you can fill in the gap if you want.</p>\n\n<div>\n\t<iframe width=\"560\"
    height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vMQdjCD3d_8\" frameborder=\"0\"
    allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>For me, I admit that the actual sessions
    and talks aren&rsquo;t the main draw of OKFestival (though they are great). For
    me, it&rsquo;s about the relationships we have with the grassroots open data community,
    without which I&rsquo;m sure the ODI wouldn&rsquo;t exist. It&rsquo;s a place
    full of people who are like-minded colleagues, but who are more importantly friends.
    It&rsquo;s a place to find out what&rsquo;s going on around the world with open
    data, and to reconnect with how important it is. To see the real examples, in
    particular from the global south, of exposed corruption and better lives for citizens,
    is incredibly important in reminding us why we do this every day. Also it can
    put context on larger issues; I will not forget in a hurry the story told by one
    attendee of actually living in a state that openly uses its surveillance machinery
    against its activist citizens to suppress dissent; this stuff is not theoretical,
    a fact we forget at our peril.</p>\n\n<p>I was asked on the OKCast (<a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://okcast.org/2014/07/okfestival-2014-james-smith-of-the-open-data-institute-interview/\">which
    you can listen to here</a>) which important conversations I thought weren&rsquo;t
    happening at OKFestival; I found it completely impossible to answer, because while
    the official sessions don&rsquo;t cover everything, the range of other conversations
    between individuals and groups happening on the sidelines is absolutely enormous.
    I am quite confident that pretty much everything was being discussed somewhere,
    and some of the side conversations I had were truly fascinating!</p>\n\n<p>One
    message that I took away was that <em>everyone</em> now understands that the challenge
    of open data isn&rsquo;t technical any more, it&rsquo;s cultural. We need to change
    the mindsets of those with power and data to accept that opening it up is a Good
    Thing, and to do that we need powerful stories and examples of where it&rsquo;s
    made a real impact, both socially and environmentally, but also economically.</p>\n\n<p>That
    cultural mind-changing is the core of our mission at the ODI, and I am quite sure
    we have a very important role to play in bringing about a future of open data
    that works for everyone; citizens, companies, and governments alike. But to do
    that, we need to stay closely connected to the grassroots community that is making
    this happen all across the world, and without which we&rsquo;d be a very lonely
    voice indeed.</p>\n"
