  content: "<p>We&rsquo;re launching a new tool today called <strong><a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://pathway.theodi.org\">Open Data Pathway</a></strong>. It&rsquo;s
    a self-assessment tool that will help you assess how well your organisation publishes
    and consumes open data, and identify actions for improvement. </p>\n\n<p>The tool
    is based on the <strong><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/maturity-model\">Open
    Data Maturity Model</a></strong> we have been developing in partnership with the
    <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs\">Department
    for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The maturity model is
    based around five themes and maturity levels. Each theme represents a broad area
    of operations within an organisation, and is broken down into areas of activity
    which can then be used to assess progress.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/public-draft-of-the-open-data-maturity-model\">previously
    published the maturity model as a public draft</a>. We would like to thank everyone
    from across central and local government, agencies and other organisations who
    have given feedback on the draft documents. Your contributions and ideas were
    extremely valuable. We&rsquo;re pleased to announce that the final, <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/maturity-model\">first edition of the model is
    now available</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open Data Pathway supports open data practitioners
    in carrying out a maturity assessment</strong>. Completing an assessment will
    create a report that scores your organisation against each activity. The report
    also includes practical recommendations that suggest how scores can be improved
    for each activity. Combined with the ability to set targets for improvement, Open
    Data Pathway provides a complete self-assessment tool to enable practitioners
    to successfully apply the maturity model to their organisation.</p>\n\n<p>Open
    Data Pathway offers a useful complement to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open
    Data Certificates</a>. The certificates <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/5-star-open-data-certificates-tim-berners-lee\">measure
    how effectively someone is sharing a dataset</a> for ease of reuse. \nOpen Data
    Pathway helps organisations assess how well they publish and consume open data,
    helping build a roadmap for their open data journey.</p>\n\n<p>We are initially
    launching the tool as an alpha release to help us gain valuable user feedback.
    The beta version will launch at the end of April, 2015, and will have the functionality
    to support results sharing and organisation benchmarking.</p>\n\n<p>Please <strong><a
    rel=\"external\" href=\"http://pathway.theodi.org\">sign up and explore the tool</a></strong>
    and <strong><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://goo.gl/forms/7Y0ZxiHqfU\">let us
    know what you think</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>This project has received funding
    from the Release of Data Fund. Many thanks to the Open Data User Group and Cabinet
    Office for their support.</em></p>\n"
