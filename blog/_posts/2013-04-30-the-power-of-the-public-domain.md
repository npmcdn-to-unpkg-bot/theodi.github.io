<p>There was a time a few years back when I felt I&rsquo;d been born into the wrong micro-era &ndash; too young to witness the very birth of the Web at close quarters, but too old to be a first-hand instigator of whatever comes next. As a PhD student in the mid-2000s I had an amazing world of opportunity around me. We did, and still do, live in interesting times &ndash; in a good way. But there was a nagging feeling that I&rsquo;d missed the boat.</p>

<p>Over the preceding decade or so the Web had revolutionised so many aspects of our lives, but the revolution wasn&rsquo;t over yet, and until it was, the world wouldn&rsquo;t be ready for any next big thing, however marvellous. These cycles of innovation and technology adoption take a long time &ndash; maybe a generation or more &ndash; by which time I&rsquo;d be over the hill and no longer flush with youthful creativity.</p>

<p>I realise now that I needn&rsquo;t have worried. The Web has unlocked such a rich bounty of opportunity that I see no end in sight. My own priorities or interests will change long before I ever run out of interesting topics to work on, fuelled by the dynamics of the Web.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://info.cern.ch/">On this day in particular</a> it&rsquo;s worth reflecting on what enabled the Web to become so pervasive. Much has already been said about the open principles underlying the Web as a hypertext system: distributed publishing, no centralised control, minimal consistency requirements, and later, open standards. But much less is said about another aspect of openness that may be of equal or greater importance &ndash; the terms under which CERN gifted the original software to the public domain *.</p>

<p>No license, no attribution requirements, nothing. It&rsquo;s worth stopping and reading the statement that encodes this waiver of rights. It&rsquo;s <a rel="external" href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164399">available as an image</a> (behind a rather unfortunate copyright notice) and <a rel="external" href="http://lynx.isc.org/release/lynx2-8-7/WWW/FreeofCharge.html">parts of the second page as text</a>. It goes:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The following CERN software is hereby put into the public domain.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>WWW basic (&ldquo;line-mode&rdquo;) client</em></li>
  <li><em>WWW basic server</em></li>
  <li><em>WWW Library of common code.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>CERN relinquishes all intellectual property rights to this code, both source and binary form and permission is granted for anyone to use, duplicate, modify and redistribute it.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Relinquishing all intellectual property rights to something so potentially profitable seems almost unthinkable today, but this example shows what can be achieved with real openness, whether it&rsquo;s applied to <a rel="external" href="http://opensource.org/" title="Open Source Initiative">software</a>, <a rel="external" href="http://opendefinition.org/" title="Open Definition">data</a>, ideas or <a rel="external" href="http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/research-software-development/seminar-smith-odi/" title="Dr James Smith on Open Development">organisational culture</a>.</p>

  <li><em>Footnote: a footnote at the bottom of <a rel="external" href="http://home.web.cern.ch/cern-people/opinion/2013/04/twenty-years-free-and-open-www">this (excellent) article</a> states: &ldquo;</em>Correction: This article originally stated that CERN put the web in the public domain. In fact the web remains CERN intellectual property but was made available on a royalty-free basis.<em>&rdquo; How that sits with the text of the original document quoted above I do not know.</em></li>
