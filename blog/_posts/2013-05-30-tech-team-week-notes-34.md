  excerpt: Last week was fairly quiet, with Stuart off on holiday, no doubt swanning
    around full of the joys of spring.

  content: "<p>Last week was fairly quiet, with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison\">Stuart</a>
    off on holiday, no doubt swanning around full of the joys of spring.</p>\n\n<p>At
    the same time, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a>
    was away most of the week in Luxembourg, full of the joys of EU research proposals;
    probably not quite as much swanning there though.</p>\n\n<p>Back in the office,
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich</a> spent
    the week trying to get hold of a dataset for another research project, attending
    a self-hacking workshop (which I&rsquo;m sure is more benign than it sounds),
    and drafting some privacy-related content for the Open Data Certificates.\x02<a
    rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/jeni-tennison\">Jeni</a> was
    also working towards the launch of the certificates, including getting all the
    styling signed off. She also spent a while trying to work out what&rsquo;s next
    after the publication of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information\">Shakespeare
    review</a> the previous week.\x02\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a>
    spent the week getting more of our applications into continuous deployment. With
    our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/services-manager\">core
    job queue manager</a> now under chef control, the robots really are taking over
    everything, which is also much more benign than it sounds.\x02<a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://theodi.org/people/james-smith\">I</a> spent the week getting the
    new logo design onto our various public-facing sites (which is never as simple
    a job as it really should be), and dealing with a few nagging\x02issues in some
    of our other services.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Sam and\x02I were trying to
    plan a new online publication platform that will let us scale the way we publish
    everything online. This meant lots of talking to the rest of the ODI, to find
    out what they really needed; good news is, we all seem to want the same things,
    and even better, we might be able to reuse a lot of things that <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/category/gds/\">GDS</a> have written
    for gov.uk. But that&rsquo;s for next week&hellip;</p>\n"
