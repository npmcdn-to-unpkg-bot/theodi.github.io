description: "We often refer to open data as a public good, but what does this mean?
  And what does it imply about how our national information infrastructure should
  be managed?\r\nWhen I say that open data is a public good, sometimes people reply,
  “but people can do bad things with open data (so it’s not really good)” or “but
  it is more easily used by people who are data literate (so it’s not really public)”.
  These statements are both true, but based on a misunderstanding of what a ‘public
  good’ is. Wikipedia says:\r\n\r\n    In economics, a public good is a good that
  is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous in that individuals cannot be effectively
  excluded from use and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to
  others.\r\n\r\nIn other words, a public good is something that you can’t stop anyone
  using, and that doesn’t get used up. The examples of public goods that people tend
  to use are “clean air”, “lighthouses” or “public parks”. Open data also fits this
  economic definition.\r\n\r\nThe objections to describing open data as a public good
  apply equally to public parks. People can do immoral or unlawful things in public
  parks: they can let their dogs make a mess, deal drugs, mug people. We don’t deal
  with this misuse by closing public parks or having identity checks at every entrance,
  but through the same laws and social norms that apply elsewhere. Similarly, misuse
  of open data such as providing out-of-date flood alerts or misrepresenting statistics
  can and should be addressed through laws and social norms, not through restricting
  access to that data.\r\n\r\nPublic parks, like other public goods, don’t benefit
  everyone equally: those that live close by and those with children or dogs benefit
  more than those who live further away or those with impaired mobility. Lighthouses
  benefit those who own and man ships, and their families, far more than anyone else.
  Similarly, open data might bring most benefits to those for whom the data is relevant,
  those who are data literate, or those who already have lots of data. But from an
  economic point of view, these public goods are non-excludable: once they are available,
  it’s impossible to prevent others from benefiting from them.\r\n\r\nPublic goods
  cost money to create and maintain, but because it’s not just the people who pay
  for it that benefit from them, it can be hard to get enough people to contribute
  to their maintenance. This is known as the free rider problem: it’s the feeling
  “why should I pay when they’re not?” If sufficient people feel that way, contributions
  to maintenance fall away, the public good falls into disrepair, and everyone loses.\r\n\r\nWhen
  it comes to open data, the fear of the free rider problem leading to open data disappearing
  can become a problem in itself. On several occasions I’ve heard people say they
  would rather pay for data because doing so reassures them that the data will continue
  to be available long term. Who would invest in developing a product or service reliant
  on a resource that could disappear at any time?\r\n\r\nWe can learn about how open
  data should be paid for by looking at how other public goods are maintained. There
  are several methods:\r\n\r\n    Government: Funding by government is the usual solution
  to the free rider problem. It removes people’s individual choices over contributing
  to public goods: we pay our taxes; government uses the money to create public goods;
  democracy and accountability act as controls over which public goods are created
  and maintained.\r\n\r\n    Collaboratives: Groups can club together to create a
  public good that all the members benefit from. To make this sustainable, and avoid
  members reneging on their commitment to contribute (while still being able to benefit
  from the public good the other members continue to maintain), such groups usually
  need to have a contractual obligation to ongoing contributions.\r\n\r\n    Cross-subsidy:
  When the group that is the primary beneficiary of a public good also has to pay
  for a private good (something members from outside the group don’t benefit from),
  a portion of the payment for the private good can be used to subsidise the public
  good.\r\n\r\n    Volunteering: Volunteering can be a powerful mechanism for maintaining
  public goods. It usually needs to be supplemented with other types of contribution
  (eg you can’t pay for servers with volunteer time), and it requires an infrastructure
  that actively provides volunteers with something useful to do.\r\n\r\n    Social
  norms: Public goods can be maintained simply due to social pressure: creating the
  public good becomes the Thing To Do (and not maintaining it disapproved of); contributing

<p>We often refer to open data as a public good, but what does this mean? And what does it imply about how our national information infrastructure should be managed?</p>
