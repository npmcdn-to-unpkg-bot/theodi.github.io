  excerpt: Week 19 commenced with a retrospective / review of Sprint Zero (which wasn’t
    really a Sprint), followed by planning for Sprint One, in which we’ve actually
    started building things for other people! We’re trying out a basic labelling system
    on github to keep track of what we are planning to do each sprint.
