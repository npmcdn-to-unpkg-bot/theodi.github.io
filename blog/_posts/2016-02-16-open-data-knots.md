    “gabe popa&quot;\">gabe popa</a>.</small> </p>\n\n<p>The patterns that the owners
    and prospective users of data fall into with each other remind me of the poems
    by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._D._Laing\">R. D.
    Laing</a> in his book <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Knots-Laing-rd/dp/0394717767\">Knots</a>.
    </p>\n\n<p>These poems explore self-perpetuating patterns of thought, action and
    conversation, usually ending in immobility and despair. Read <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://www.oikos.org/knotpageen.htm\">some extracts</a> to get a sense
    of the style.</p>\n\n<p>The basic open data knot goes something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>OWNER:
    I do not know what data you want\n       So I do not know what to give you.\n\n
    USER: I do not know what data you have\n       So I do not know what to ask you
    for.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Digging a little into the thinking behind this knot:</p>\n\n<pre><code>OWNER:
    If I give you data\n       And you do not build anything with it\n       It will
    be a waste of time and money.\n\n       I do not want to waste time and money\n
    \      So I need to know what you will build\n       With the data I give you.\n\n
    USER: If I come up with an idea\n       And you do not have that data\n       It
    will be a waste of time and money.\n       \n       I do not want to waste time
    and money\n       So I need to know what data you have\n       That I can build
    with.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At this point, prospective data users spot a way out
    of the knot, namely getting a list of datasets. My observation is that this seldom
    lives up to its promise because the interaction goes something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>
    USER: If you make a list of the data you have\n       I will know what data you
    have\n       And will know what I can build\n       And will know what to ask
    you for.\n\nOWNER: Here is a list of the data I have\n       So now you know what
    data I have\n       So you know what you can build\n       So you know what to
    ask me for.\n\n USER: I am mad because\n       The list includes so much data
    I do not want\n       I cannot work out what I can build\n       And do not know
    what to ask you for.\n\nOWNER: I am mad because\n       I gave you a list\n       And
    you have not told me what you can build\n       And what data you want.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The
    other solution I&rsquo;ve seen users suggest is for publishers to just publish
    everything. Again, this tends to fall into a bad state:</p>\n\n<pre><code> USER:
    If you give me all the data you have\n       Then I will build something.\n\nOWNER:
    I will give you the data I can give you.\n       If you build something with this
    data\n       Then I will give you more data.\n\n USER: I am mad because\n       You
    have given me a lot of data I do not want.\n       I cannot build anything\n       With
    the data you have given me.\n\nOWNER: I am mad because\n       I have given you
    data\n       And you have not built anything.\n       I do not believe you need
    any of my data.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both data owners and prospective data users
    get trapped in these knots. Both are frustrated by the other&rsquo;s actions or
    lack of action. They talk past each other and feel powerless to change the other&rsquo;s
    behaviour.</p>\n\n<h3>What makes for successful open data publication?</h3>\n\n<p>When
    I look at successes in open data publication, where both data owners and users
    feel they are benefiting, they tend to be around:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Where
    users have very clear ideas about what they want to build and are persistent in
    pursuing the release of that data. This may be because the data is already accessible
    in some form under a restrictive licence (eg for money or only for research purposes),
    so users know it exists and understand its utility.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Where
    a data owner both publishes data and engages a wider community of potential users
    (or other parts of their own organisation) to use that data with their own very
    clear strategic goals in mind, in order to satisfy the owner&rsquo;s public task
    more efficiently, for example.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Where data owners
    and data users are the same types of organisations, who work together collaboratively
    to maintain a data asset that everyone benefits from.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Identifying
    shared goals</h3>\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s common in all these situations is the close
    collaboration between data owners and users. This requires data owners and users
    to have shared goals, to see the relationship as symbiotic rather than parasitic.
    It&rsquo;s rare that everyone starts out with shared goals. It takes time to develop
    a common language, to identify common problems and to build trust that everyone
    is committed to solving them.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatachallenges.org\">Open
    Data Challenge Series</a> provided a very successful model for bringing together
    a group of stakeholders around a shared challenge, by taking a sector focus. It
    had a predicted ROI of 5–10x through getting startups and small businesses to
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/news/investment-in-open-data-challenge-series-could-see-10fold-return-to-uk-economy-over-3-years\">create
    new products using open data</a>. It <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatachallenges.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/LESSONS-from-the-ODCS-Report2.pdf\">wasn&rsquo;t
    as successful</a> at getting data owners to publish new or higher-quality data.
    </p>\n\n<p>This year, we&rsquo;ll be investigating other ways of bringing together
    people and organisations across <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/our-focus\">different
    sectors</a> to bring data to bear on their shared goals.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Jeni
