  excerpt: This week was a short week (because Easter), but I spent much of my time
    wrestling with the Google Calendar API, building an app that will allow our members

    <p>This week was a short week (because Easter), but I spent much of my time wrestling with the Google Calendar API, building an <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi/office-calendar">app that will allow our members to see what desks, pods and rooms have been booked</a>, and eventually be able to book them themselves.</p>

    <p><a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley">Sam</a> spent the week getting our Ops ducks in rows, and migrated much of our code to Rackspace.</p>

    <p><a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/james-smith">James</a> wrestled with various annoying problems with external APIs and worked more on our newly launched <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi/member-directory">Member Directory</a>.</p>

    <p><a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/jeni">Jeni</a> had a meeting with Virgin on how they are going to publish their open data, attended an open contracting workshop with the World Bank and continued work on the Open Data Certificates.</p>

    <p>We also played with <a rel="external" href="https://code.google.com/p/gource/">Gource</a> to generate some cool-looking visualisations of our source code - like this:</p>
