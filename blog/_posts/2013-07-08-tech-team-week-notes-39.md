    alt=\"Penguin James\" />Last week started with a change of scenery, as the ODI
    decamped to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/GreatBrampton\">Great
    Brampton House</a> in Herefordshire, for two days of intensive strategic planning.
    During the quieter periods, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a>
    and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich</a>
    mastered the finer points of\x02croquet, while the rest of us practised our Gin
    &amp; Tonic technique.\x02Having then laid out our plans for our next three months,
    we then returned to London to catch up on all the work we missed while we were
    away.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/jeni-tennison\">Jeni</a>
    started with\x02a coordination chat with the OKFN, followed by doing a webinar
    on data standards for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opendataresearch.org/\">ODDC</a>
    on Thursday. Friday brought a keynote at the &ldquo;Managing Research Data with
    Linked Data&rdquo;\x02seminar\x02organised by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.ac.uk\">data.ac.uk</a>.
    Meanwhile,\x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom</a>
    ploughed through his backlog after getting back from India, and then got <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/maximilian-heimst%C3%A4dt/27/634/662\">Max</a>,
    one of our new research interns, settled in. Max, in turn, started the data collection
    for his\x02MSc dissertation project. To get a picture of the UK Open Data ecosystem,
    he conducted interviews with various people inside and outside the ODI, and participated
    in events like the OKFN meet-up and the Science and Technology Foundation roundtable
    discussion.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison\">Stuart</a>
    and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich</a>\x02spent
    the week working on a secret project, which Stuart has codenamed &ldquo;Qiameth&rdquo;
    for reasons known only to him and the random word generator he used. It&rsquo;s
    unusual for us to not be working in a 100% open way, but this is a temporary situation;
    the result will be fully open once it&rsquo;s ready for release! It&rsquo;s looking
    good; you&rsquo;ll like it.\x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a>
    spent some time improving our Chef robots to handle multiple deployment branches,
    and also diving headlong into data munging in Ruby, for the same secret project.</p>\n\n<p>When
    not wearing a penguin mask (pictured above), <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/james-smith\">I</a>
    spent a while improving our build system, and have replaced a whole load of hairy
    Jenkins configuration with a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://github.com/theodi/master-builder\">pretty
    short DSL script</a>, which\x02I&rsquo;ll cover in more detail in a future blog
    post.</p>\n"
