  excerpt: 'Week #41 was a big week. The veil was finally lifted on our latest project,
    “Show me the money”, which revealed some of the patterns in the burgeoning peer-to-peer
    lending market and was covered on the front page of the Financial Times (main
    story here with another related story inside the paper). The project was a collaboration
    between the ODI, the Bank of England, and the P2P lenders. Ulrich led the way
    from our side, with support from Stuart, Sam, James and Jeni in getting the project
    site live. There are some notes online on the methodology used in the analysis,

    on GitHub.'

    <p>Week #41 was a big week. The veil was finally lifted on our latest project, &ldquo;<a rel="external" href="http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/">Show me the money</a>&rdquo;, which revealed some of the patterns in the burgeoning peer-to-peer lending market and was covered on the front page of the Financial Times (<a rel="external" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/28bf596c-eafb-11e2-bfdb-00144feabdc0.html">main story here</a> with another <a rel="external" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8a03efee-ed3a-11e2-ad6e-00144feabdc0.html">related story</a> inside the paper). The project was a collaboration between the ODI, the Bank of England, and the P2P lenders. <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz">Ulrich</a> led the way from our side, with support from <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison">Stuart</a>, <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley">Sam</a>, <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/james-smith">James</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/jeni">Jeni</a> in getting the project site live. There are some notes online on the <a rel="external" href="http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/methodology/">methodology used in the analysis</a>, and the <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi/R-projects/tree/master/peer-to-peer">code itself is on GitHub</a>. The <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/theodi/p2p">code for the project site</a> itself is also on GitHub.</p>

    <p>That big news aside, James squashed some bugs in our ever-growing <a rel="external" href="http://directory.theodi.org/members">member directory</a>, while he and Stuart kicked the tyres of the gov.uk Web publishing platform harder than before to see if it will fit the bill for our own, much longed-for, publishing platform. The answer seems to be &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Ulrich and I worked some more on an interesting client project that involved heated debates about survey design. In case you&rsquo;re wondering, the answer is clearly &ldquo;a 5-point <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale">Likert scale</a>&rdquo;, almost irrespective of the question ;)</p>

    <p>Having recovered from the mental exertion of intellectual sparring with Ulrich (with Jeni providing the voice of reason) I finally got the job advert out the door for a <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/jobs/community-engagement-manager">Community Engagement Manager</a> to work with me and others on two European projects we have in the pipeline. If you know anyone who fits the bill, then please check out the advert and encourage them to make the most of the novel application procedure. <a rel="external" href="http://theodi.org/people/david-tarrant">Dave</a> was tied up all week teaching the latest run of our flagship <a rel="external" href="http://www.theodi.org/courses/open-data-practice">Open Data in Practice course</a>, while our research interns Eric and Max pressed on with their Masters dissertation research, including the rare fortune of 1:1 time (ok, strictly speaking 2:1) with <a rel="external" href="http://www.mysociety.org/about-tom-steinberg/">Tom Steinberg</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://rufuspollock.org/">Rufus Pollock</a>.</p>

    <p>Jeni engaged <a rel="external" href="https://twitter.com/brianhoadley">Brian Hoadley</a> to help us manage the development of our web platform over the next few months, had some interesting meetings with Medecin Sans Frontieres and HSCIC, prepared for the Board meeting this week and tried to frame responses to consultations on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/open-government-partnership-uk-draft-national-action-plan-2013/ogp-uk-2013-draft-national-action-plan-from-open-data-to-open-government">UK&rsquo;s Open Data National Action Plan</a> and PASC&rsquo;s <a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-administration-select-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/statistics/statistics-open-data/">call for written evidence on open data and statistics</a>.</p>
