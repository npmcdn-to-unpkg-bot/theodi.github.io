    you are usually doing so\x02because you want people to reuse it. But how do you
    get them to do that\x02?</p>\n\n<p>Engaging with potential reusers needs to start
    early and should be an ongoing process. This ensures that\x02organisations publish
    the right data in the right ways, and\x02get the right people to use it in ways
    that help them achieve their objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Engagement is about recognising
    that open data isn&rsquo;t just about technology: it&rsquo;s about people and
    communities using data to help them make decisions. Helping reusers to understand
    what data means and what its limitations are can help organisations maximise the
    value of releasing open data in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>To help organisations
    identify ways of getting\x02reusers interested in their data, we&rsquo;ve <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://personal.crocodoc.com/hkxDozZ\">drafted a guide</a> and we&rsquo;re
    looking for comments on it. What are the strategies that have worked for you?
    If you are a reuser, how would you like data publishers to engage with you?</p>\n\n<p>Feel
    free to <a href=\"&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#106;&#101;&#110;&#105;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#111;&#100;&#105;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;\">email</a>,
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ukodi\">tweet</a>, or comment directly
    on the draft. In a few weeks time, we&rsquo;ll roll in your comments and publish
    both the finished guide and a post that summarises the comments we receive. Thanks
    in advance!</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://personal.crocodoc.com/hkxDozZ\">Comment
