  excerpt: I recently wrote about work underway at the ODI to help improve the machine
    readability of data licensing information. We’ve already received some welcome
    feedback which has resulted in updates to the guides and the Open Data Rights
    Statement schema. If you’ve not looked at the material yet then please let us
    know if you have comments.

  content: "<p>I <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/machine-readable-rights-statements\">recently
    wrote</a> about work underway at the ODI to help improve the machine readability
    of data licensing information. We&rsquo;ve already received some welcome feedback
    \x02which has resulted in updates to the guides and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/\">Open
    Data Rights Statement</a> schema. If you&rsquo;ve not looked at the material \x02yet
    then please let us know if you have comments.</p>\n\n<p>The\x02 schema, along
    with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/guide/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing\">publisher</a>
    and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/guide/reusers-guide-open-data-licensing\">re-user</a>\x02
    guides to open data licensing, provides \x02some useful advice for anyone looking
    to publish or use open data. Ensuring that your rights statement is machine-readable
    is also a key part of achieving a higher <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://certificate.theodi.org\">certification
    for your dataset</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However there are still some \x02areas in which
    we&rsquo;ve found that people need more guidance around the implications of open
    data licences:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>how does an open licence affect your ability
    to create new, derived datasets?</li>\n  <li>what are the implications for mixing
    together data and content that are covered by different open licences?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These
    issues are particularly relevant for people looking to build <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://www.theodi.org/guide/how-make-business-case-open-data\">business
    models</a> around open data, which often involve combining and enriching data
    from multiple sources. While it can be obvious \x02how a licence might support
    building a product on a dataset, the implications of combining data published
    under \x02different licences \x02are not always clear.</p>\n\n<p>To help address
    this we&rsquo;ve put together <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/blob/master/guides/licence-compatibility.md\">an
    introductory document on &ldquo;licence compatibility&rdquo;</a>. This document
    and the supporting matrices attempt to provide:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a summary of
    the key facets of the most common open data licences</li>\n  <li>a discussion
    of the issues and use cases around licence compatibility</li>\n  <li>a matrix
    describing\x02 which \x02licences can be used when publishing derived datasets
    based upon a single source</li>\n  <li>a matrix describing how\x02 datasets derived
    from multiple sources might \x02be licensed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The document builds
    on\x02 previous work by the Creative Commons, extending\x02 it to include licences
    from the Open Data Commons and the UK public sector. \x02The ultimate goal is
    to have a clearer set of guidance to support these use cases along with some tools
    to help guide people towards choosing the best licence for their work.\x02</p>\n\n<p>The
    document is still at an early stage and would benefit from review and feedback
    from the wider community. \x02We would love\x02 to hear your feedback on the work
    to date. If you&rsquo;d like to contribute then please\x02 <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/issues\">submit issues and
    \x02comments on github</a>.</p>\n"
