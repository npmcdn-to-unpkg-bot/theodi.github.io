  excerpt: Our report, Show me the Money[link to website] provides the most comprehensive
    snapshot to date of the UK peer-to-peer lending (P2P) market. Using data from
    the three biggest P2P platforms in the UK (Zopa, RateSetter and Funding Circle)
    we highlight the regional geography of lending in the UK. This is thefirst time
    anyone has published financial data with an open data certificate.

  content: "<p>Our report, <em>Show me the Money</em>\x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org\">[link
    to website]</a> provides the most comprehensive snapshot to date of the UK peer-to-peer
    lending (P2P) market. Using data from the three biggest P2P platforms in the UK
    (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://uk.zopa.com/\">Zopa</a>, <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://www.ratesetter.com/\">RateSetter</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fundingcircle.com/\">Funding
    Circle</a>) we highlight the regional geography of lending in the UK. This is
    the\x02first time anyone has published financial data with an <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">open data certificate</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You
    can download the report as a PDF-document <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/ODI-P2P-report-16jul13.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regions
    in the South lend\x02more but the UK is surprisingly balanced when it comes to
    recipients</strong></p>\n\n<p>Key differences in UK regional activity from the
    report include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Scotland, the North East and the North West
    have similar statistics for <em>pounds received per person</em>.</li>\n  <li>There
    is substantially more lending in London and the South of the UK but recipients
    are evenly distributed across the country.</li>\n  <li>Four regions invest more
    than they receive. All four - London, South East, South West and the East of England
    - are in the South of the UK.</li>\n  <li>The range of lending per person ranges
    from £1.40 to £11.80 between UK regions, whereas the range for recipients only
    varies between £3.90 and £7.30 per person.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some quick stats
    from the report:</p>\n\n<table class=\"table\"><tbody><tr><td>Time period</td><td>From
    October 2010 to May 2013</td></tr><tr><td>Number of lenders</td><td>48,891</td></tr><tr><td>Number
    of recipients</td><td>59,851</td></tr><tr><td>Number of loan parts</td><td>~ 14
    million*</td></tr><tr><td>Total amount</td><td>£378 million</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>\x02</p>\n\n<p>The
    unit of analysis is a loan part. A recipient who takes out a loan of, for example,\x02£5,000
    may receive the money from hundreds of different lenders. Vice versa, a lender
    may subdivide her investment into many loans. A typical (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/methodology#median\">median</a>)
    amount for a loan part is £10. However, in a small number of cases the investment
    per loan part is substantially larger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>An interactive visualisation
    with the consumer in mind</strong></p>\n\n<p>One reason for opening up this data
    is to build consumers&rsquo; trust by being transparent. We also wanted to give
    individuals a way of exploring this vast data set. The visualisation allows you
    to drill into a specific region of the UK and compare it to the rest of the country.
    As the data derives from individuals, it is of course personal data. However,
    we went to great length, including carrying out a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/privacy/\">small-scale\x02privacy
    impact assessment</a>,\x02to protect people&rsquo;s privacy.\x02\n<a rel=\"external\"

    alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Growth in the market is expected to continue</strong></p>\n\n<p>P2P
    lending has been growing rapidly over the last few years. The visualisations below
    show how more and more people joined the market either as lenders or recipients.
    Each dot represents an individual.</p>\n\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Growth

    alt=\"Recipients\" title=\"\" /></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<p><strong>Towards
    a real-time map of the financial market</strong></p>\n\n<p>A broader lesson from
    this project is that publishing this sort of granular financial data is possible.
    We demonstrate here how to publish open data and how to make it accessible. In
    sum this project is a step toward a more publicly transparent and comprehensive
    mapping of the financial system. Eventually we hope this map will become updated
    in real-time with data feeds directly sourced from P2P platforms and other financial
    markets.</p>\n\n<p>Go on and have a play -\x02<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org\">show
    yourself the money!</a></p>\n"
